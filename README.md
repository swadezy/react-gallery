## Description

For this project, I was tasked with creating a 'gallery of my life'. This gallery features photos that can be clicked to toggle a details view for each photo, as well as a 'like' button that increments likes, and a delete button that deletes that photo. This info is all stored in a database, details of which can be found in the database.sql file. To set this project up, create a database with that database.sql code, run npm install in the project, npm run server, and npm run client.
